	<b>MX Select Plus</b> makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly with Chosen plugin. It is also open option to user to add new items into the list "on the fly". You can setup to save new options on field level (to be available for choosing in all entrees) or just once.  Support Matrix-like fields, Low Variables, SafeCracker.  And you can also populate list with custom SQL queries.
